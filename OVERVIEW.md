# overview

A level starts, ragdoll + all elements animate according to gravity, mass,
and any other external forces. ragdoll takes damage the more and harder it
is struck (extra points for head shots...?).  Each level requires surpassing
a "damage" point threshold to pass; subsequent levels introduce increasing
complexity and new items into the world

Physical size of each level varies, meaning you must be creative with your
tools in the context of a particular conte.  Use things differently if higher
ceiling / bigger / xmaller space., etc.

questions
 - are items 100% addititive each level? ie. you keep getting new things? Or
 can some be taken away / changed / reset and each level is a completely
 separate experience.  Or, could we have "stages" where you slowly accrue
 more items, working towards and specific "end level" in which you use all
 that stages' accrued items...?


# level design

## variable height worlds / size of each level varies
  - the user might find that the ceiling is higher, in a level. (and thus, can
    drop ragdoll from higher).

## need xxx points to advance.
  - TBD

## each level has more obstacles to mess with, move around
  - some things can be picked up, and _repositioned_
    - when level starts, they pay tribute to gravity
  - some things are too heavy, permanent
  - some things might have their own direction when the level start -- that is _not_ just gravity.
    - truck
    - rocket
      - only 2,3 in the game
## items
  - block
  - movable block (different color / has handles ...?)
  - wedge
  - stone / sphere
  - stairs
  - slingshot
  - truck


# "cowclicker"
- social-ify it
- share scores (and initial positions to achieve them, if anyone wants to replay / improve)

# customization
- can add your friends faces to head mesh.
- save in LS or firebase (...?)
